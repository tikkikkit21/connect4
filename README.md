# connect4

Connect4, but better!

## The Idea
A friend of mine and I really enjoyed playing Connect 4 (we're Discord friends, so we played via [boardgames.io](https://boardgames.io/)). We tended to be tryhards and enjoyed analyzing moves after each game. However, there wasn't a convenient way to replay moves so we often had rely on our unreliable memory. As a result, I decided to code a custom connect4 game that featured a replayable move history (similar to online chess).

## Technology
This project is written in TypeScript, using the React.js framework. It was initially bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/) before being migrated to [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) since it was more secure and had less dependency vulnerabilities.

## Features
_This project is still very much in the development phase so there's not a whole lot to list_ ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
